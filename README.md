# Project 3: Spots

## 📸 Overview

**Spots** is an image-sharing site where users can add, like, preview, and delete image cards. Users can also edit their profile and avatar.

This project was built as part of the TripleTen Web Development curriculum. It is fully responsive and works on all screen sizes. The layout uses a modern card-based design with hover effects, popups, and smooth transitions. All data interactions are synced with a REST API.
